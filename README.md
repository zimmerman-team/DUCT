## DUCT: Data Universal Conversion Tool

[![License: AGPLv3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-AGPL%20v3-blue.svg)](https://github.com/zimmerman-zimmerman/DUCT/blob/master/LICENSE.MD)

DUCT is Django application which allows user to convert CSV files to a harmonised datastore modelled on the SDMX standard with a standardised output. It provides two different API' to interface the data either to convert (PUT) and extract data in your bespoke IU (GET). DUCT makes use of The Django REST API as a base API and on top of this, it provides GraphQL to connect to your datastore for data modelling, data conversion, data integration and data interfacing.

DUCT has been build as part of Zoom, a Data platform for data informed
strategy in combating the AIDS epidemic in cooperation with Aidsfonds that
works towards ending AIDS in a world where all people affected by HIV/AIDS have access to prevention, treatment, care and support and HumanityX who are supporting organisations in the peace, justice and humanitarian sectors to adopt digital innovations in order to increase their impact on society.

#### Auth0

DUCT uses <a href="https://auth0.com" >auth0</a> for authenticated access to certain endpoints and certain data.

## Set up

---

- `git clone https://github.com/zimmerman-zimmerman/DUCT.git`
- `cd DUCT`
- `sudo sh bin/setup/install_dependencies.sh`
- Run `virtualenv <name> -p python3` to create a virtual environment
- Run `source env/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment
- `pip install -r ZOOM/requirements.txt`
- `sudo sh bin/setup/sync_db.sh`
- `sudo sh bin/setup/create_django_user.sh`
- `cd ZOOM/scripts`
- If you want to have geolocations for Netherlands PC4 digit areas in your DUCT please download it here <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UndI3jQJPY7psdi-IgdZ3eYi5B4DkMxS/view?usp=sharing">PC4 geo json</a> and add it to your 'DUCT/ZOOM/geodata/data_backup' folder. Note it might take up to 30mins more for the set up project script to finish if you have this file.
- If you want to have geolocations for Netherlands PC6 digit areas in your DUCT please download it here <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ad2Eb3RD427UtMB2pM_HZqmyZI8u6Ll6/view?usp=sharing">PC6 geo json</a> and add it to your 'DUCT/ZOOM/geodata/data_backup' folder. Note it might take up to 1 day or more for the set up project script to finish if you have this file.
- `./setup_project.sh`
- `cd ..`
- Create a file called 'local_settings.py' in the folder 'DUCT/ZOOM/ZOOM' and add these variables to it(Note: these are basically used for sending email, after data mapping is done):

  ````
    # SEND EMAIL CONFIG

    EMAIL_HOST = your_email_host
    EMAIL_PORT = your_email_host_port
    EMAIL_HOST_USER = your_email_host_user
    EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = your_email_host_password
    EMAIL_USE_TLS = True

    # TASKS

    ZOOM_TASK_EMAIL_CONFIRMATION_ENABLE = True
    ZOOM_TASK_EMAIL_SENDER = your_email_sender
    ZOOM_TASK_EMAIL_RECEIVER = your_default_email_receiver
   ```
  ````

- Also in your local_settings.py ^ you can add this variable 'POCESS_WORKER_AMOUNT=' and specify a number of desired process workers. Basically this is used for big geodata processing, data that contains more than 40000 data points. Of course the amount of process workers to be used would very much be dependant on your machine, it should never exceed the amount of cores your machine has, and of course if you use to many process workers(like 20) it might work slower in comparison to using less process workers(like 4) because of pre process initiation tasks. The default of this variable is already set to 2.
- In 'DUCT/ZOOM' folder create a file called '.env' and add these variables to it(mainly used for specific DUCT endpoints that can only be accessed with a user signed in via auth0 api):
  ```
   AUTH0_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
   API_IDENTIFIER=your_auth_api_identifier
  ```
- In 'DUCT/ZOOM' folder create a folder called 'media' and inside that one create a folder called 'tmpfiles'(If these were not already created)
- Start your rabbitmq service
- `python manage.py runserver`
- Reactivate your virtual environment if it was deactivated, then in the folder 'DUCT/ZOOM' run the celery worker `-A ZOOM worker -l info`
- Reactivate your virtual environment if it was deactivated, then in the folder 'DUCT/ZOOM' run the celery beat `-A ZOOM beat -l info`

or

If you have Docker installed:

- Open file called 'docker_settings.py' in the folder 'DUCT/ZOOM/ZOOM' and fill in these variables:

  ````
    # SEND EMAIL CONFIG

    EMAIL_HOST = your_email_host
    EMAIL_PORT = your_email_host_port
    EMAIL_HOST_USER = your_email_host_user
    EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = your_email_host_password
    EMAIL_USE_TLS = True

    # TASKS

    ZOOM_TASK_EMAIL_CONFIRMATION_ENABLE = True
    ZOOM_TASK_EMAIL_SENDER = your_email_sender
    ZOOM_TASK_EMAIL_RECEIVER = your_default_email_receiver
   ```
  ````

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

...and visit `0.0.0.0:8000`.

This will start a **development** environment (using Django's development server) for DUCT.

Note, that DUCT Docker image will be pulled from Docker HUB and not built locally.

## Extra Info

- Make sure that your tippecanoe executable is in '/usr/local/bin/tippecanoe' OR if you have it somewhere else, make sure to add the variable 'TIPPECANOE_DIR' to your local_settings.py pointing to the directory containing tippecanoe executable. For the recommended/default case it would look like `TIPPECANOE_DIR = '/usr/local/bin/'`

## Documentation

---

### clone the project

```
sudo apt-get install git
git clone https://github.com/zimmerman-zimmerman/DUCT.git;
cd DUCT;
```

### Install dependencies

Install all the dependencies in the bin/setup/install_dependencies.sh folder.

```
sudo sh bin/setup/install_dependencies.sh
```

Install a python virtual environment

```
sudo apt-get install python-pip;
sudo pip install virtualenvwrapper;
export WORKON_HOME=~/envs;
/usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh;
source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh;
mkvirtualenv zoom;
workon zoom;
```

Install pip packages

```
cd ZOOM
pip install --upgrade pip;
pip install -r ZOOM/requirements.txt;
```

### Configuration

Create a database

```
sudo -u postgres bash -c "psql -c \"CREATE USER zoom WITH PASSWORD 'zoom';\""
sudo -u postgres bash -c "psql -c \"ALTER ROLE zoom SUPERUSER;\""
sudo -u postgres bash -c "psql -c \"CREATE DATABASE zoom;\""
```

Migrate the database, create a superuser, and run the server (for production, we use nginx/gunicorn).

```
cd ZOOM/scripts
sh setup_project.sh
cd ../
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py runserver
```

Eventually, you could add your modifications to the Django configuration in a new file at ZOOM/local_settings.py
